# Welcome to my first repository.
I'm learning how to use Git and GitHub, it's been super fun however there are some things I'm strugglin to uderstand, I need:

- To study more.
- To practice more.
- To start a complex project so I can put all the knowledge to test.

# Conclusions

- It is not as complicated as expected, I definitely felt intimidated by the concept and thought it would be more complex.
- I might not have enough time to full put to test everything learnt
- It is imperative to continue practicing.
- Last but not least, I need to retake some clases from previouses courses as there are a lot of topics I have forgotten already.
